This is a small selection of maps and data visualizations created using QGIS, MapboxGL, Adobe Illustrator, Power BI, Microsoft Excel, and ArcGIS.  

## MapboxGL JS
This map was created using MapboxGL JS and shows manually classified online housing posts (Craigslist, VRBO, etc.) that were used as a machine learning training dataset. This data was delivered to the City of Surrey as part of the 2018 UBC Data Science for Social Good program:
