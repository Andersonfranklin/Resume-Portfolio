This is a small selection of maps and data visualizations created using MapboxGL JS, Microsoft Power BI, Microsoft Office Suite, QGIS, Adobe Illustrator, and ArcGIS.  

## MapboxGL JS
This map was created using MapboxGL JS and shows manually classified online housing posts (Craigslist, VRBO, etc.) that were used as a machine learning training dataset. This data was delivered to the City of Surrey as part of the <a href = "https://dsi.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/Housing%20%E2%80%94%20Final%20Presentation.pdf" title = "2018 DSSG" target = "_blank"> 2018 UBC Data Science for Social Good program: </a>

## Microsoft Office Suite
Survey data was frequently collected using SimpleSurvey and processed using Microsoft Excel. In this example, business owners were asked to respond to a number of questions to determine how their businesses had been impacted by COVID-19.

The complete set of graphs was delivered to Surrey City Council and can be found <a href = "https://ubc-geob472-spring2019.github.io/andersonfranklin-web/Business Impact Survey Results formatted - v3.pdf" title = "Business Impact Survey Results" target = "_blank"> here. </a>

The province of BC declared a public state of emergency for COVID-19 on March 18th, 2020. Each week since the declaration was made, I have collected, processed, and created visualizations for epidemiological data provided by Johns Hopkins University. Two examples of the charts that are updated weekly can be found below:
